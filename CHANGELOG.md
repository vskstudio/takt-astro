# @vskstudio/takt-astro

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Realign the README with the package code: the autocapture selector is `[data-takt-event]`, the default ingest endpoint is the hosted Takt collect URL, and the documented component props match what `Takt.astro` actually accepts. No runtime change.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Require takt-core >=0.6.0, whose default ingest endpoint and stats/widget host are now the hosted Takt origin (https://taktlytics.com). Docs updated to match; no wrapper code change.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- dfe06bd: Expose advanced tracker options: enabled, sampleRate, trackQuery, queryParams,
  scrubUrl (function, build-time stringified / config only) and tagged. Peer dep raised to takt-core >=0.5.0.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Lock the widget `src` so consumer attributes can't override the built URL, and add `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"` to the embed iframe.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add native `TaktBadge` and `TaktEmbed` widget components and re-export the public stats client (`createStats`) and widget URL builders from `@vskstudio/takt-core`. Requires `@vskstudio/takt-core` >= 0.3.0.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix the `<Takt />` component never running in production builds. It shipped an `is:inline` module whose bare `@vskstudio/takt-core` import the browser couldn't resolve, and it imported its helpers from `src/` (absent from the published tarball). The component now passes options through a JSON data island and boots from a bundled module that resolves the core import. Same single-pageview-per-navigation behaviour as the integration.
- 3676d9e: Fix client-side navigations emitting several pageviews each. Astro's ClientRouter runs multiple history operations per navigation, so relying on core's history patch over-counted. The runtime now drives pageviews from `astro:after-swap` (one per navigation) plus a single explicit initial pageview.

## 0.2.0

Initial release.

- Default-export `takt(options)` Astro integration that injects the Takt runtime via `astro:config:setup`.
- `<Takt />` component for manual placement in a layout `<head>`.
- View Transitions support: re-fires a pageview on `astro:page-load`, skipping the initial load to avoid double-counting.
- SSR/prerender safe; runs only in the browser.
- Re-exports core `track` / `pageview` / `optOut` / `optIn`.
